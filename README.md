# plant-species-classification-using-resnet

Description of the dataset :

This dataset is created using offline augmentation from the original dataset. The original PlantVillage Dataset can be found here.This dataset consists of about 87K rgb images of healthy and diseased crop leaves which is categorized into 38 different classes. The total dataset is divided into 80/20 ratio of training and validation set preserving the directory structure. A new directory containing 33 test images is created later for prediction purpose.


Our goal :

Goal is clear and simple. We need to build a model, which can classify between healthy and diseased crop leaves and also if the crop have any disease, predict which disease is it.

Importing necessary libraries:

Let's import required modules
!pip install torchsummary
import os                       # for working with files
import numpy as np              # for numerical computationss
import pandas as pd             # for working with dataframes
import torch                    # Pytorch module 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # for plotting informations on graph and images using tensors
import torch.nn as nn           # for creating  neural networks
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader # for dataloaders 
from PIL import Image           # for checking images
import torch.nn.functional as F # for functions for calculating loss
import torchvision.transforms as transforms   # for transforming images into tensors 
from torchvision.utils import make_grid       # for data checking
from torchvision.datasets import ImageFolder  # for working with classes and images
from torchsummary import summary              # for getting the summary of our model
%matplotlib inline
